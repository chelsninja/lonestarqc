        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Lone Star Quidditch Club was established in the summer of 2013 as the brainchild of Kody Marshall and Mollie
            Lensing who each graduated from University of Texas and Texas A&M University respectively. These previous rivals
            dreamed of building the first competitive community team in Texas that would allow players all across the state
            to continue playing the sport they love even after graduating college.</p>
        <p>Initially, the team was split across all the major cities in Texas including Austin, Dallas, and Houston.
            Before the teamâ€™s first match was even played, there were extremely high expectations for this team to
            immediately find success in the Southwest region and be in contention for the National trophy. LSQC made
            it all the way to the Elite Eight of the National tournament in its very first year finishing the season
            with a strong winning record, and in the Spring of 2015 the team won the regional title and finished in
            2nd place out of 80 teams at the National tournament.</p>
        <p>Lone Star was built on a foundation of athletic excellence as well as community. The team supports one
            another on and off the field and looks to expand that support system in the coming year while still
            competing as one of the top teams in the sport.</p>
