        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Established in the summer of 2013, Lone Star Quidditch Club is the brainchild of Kody Marshall and Mollie
            Lensing. Marshall and Lensing, as alumni of University of Texas and Texas A&M University respectively, were
            fierce rivals at one point, but dreamed of building the first competitive community team in Texas. Such a
            team would allow players all across the state of Texas to continue playing the sport they love, even after
            graduating college.</p>
        <p>Initially, the team was split across several major cities in Texas, including Austin, Dallas, and Houston.
            Before the team's first match was even played, it had already garnered extremely high expectations to
            immediately find success in the Southwest region and be in contention for the National trophy. They did not
            disappoint. LSQC made it all the way to the Elite Eight of the National tournament in its very first year,
            finishing the season with a strong winning record. In Spring 2015, the team captured the regional title and
            finished in second place out of 80 teams at the National tournament.</p>
        <p>LSQC was built on a foundation of not only athletic excellence, but community. Members of the team support
            one another on and off the pitch. They are looking forward to expanding that support system in the coming
            year while still competing as one of the top teams in the sport.</p>
