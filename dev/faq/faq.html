        <accordion-group heading="How does the snitch work?">
            A person not affiliated with either team will act as the snitch. He or she wear a snitch tail on their
            yellow shorts, and the goal for the seeker is to remove that tail - similar to flag football. A snitch
            catch rewards the team with 30 points and ends the game.

        <accordion-group heading="Do you wear protection with the broom?">
            A few players wear cups but the broom is never an issue in that regard.

        <accordion-group heading="Do people get impaled by the broom?">
            Not as often as you think. The most common injuries are concussions and broken collar bones.
